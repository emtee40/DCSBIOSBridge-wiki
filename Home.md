## DCSBIOSDataBroker transfers data from ```dcs-bios``` to your ```serial ports``` and vice versa


### dcs-bios communication
* The cog wheel spins when data is received from ```dcs-bios```

### Serial ports
* You can configure the serial ports by ```right-clicking``` them and choose ```Configure```
* If you have a serial port that isn't used with ```dcs-bios``` just remove it via the top right icon. It won't be included in the profile after that.

### dcs-bios settings
* ```Edit``` => ```Options``` and you can set the ```dcs-bios``` socket settings
