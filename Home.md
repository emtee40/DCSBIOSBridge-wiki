## DCSBIOSBridge transfers data between ```dcs-bios``` and your ```serial ports```

### Creating a profile
This helps keeping your settings from session to session. Save anywhere and read from anywhere.

### dcs-bios communication
* The cog wheel spins when data is received from ```dcs-bios```

### Serial ports
* You can configure the serial ports by ```right-clicking``` them and choose ```Configure```
* If you have a serial port that isn't used with ```dcs-bios``` just remove it via the top right icon. It won't be included in the profile after that.
* Click the magnifier to add all ```serial ports``` found by Windows to the profile
* If you have a serial port in your profile that isn't found by Windows it will be dimmed. To removed it go to ```Options``` => ```Remove disabled ports```.

### dcs-bios settings
* ```Edit``` => ```Options``` and you can set the ```dcs-bios``` socket settings
